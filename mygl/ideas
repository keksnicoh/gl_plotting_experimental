ideas

- glDrawElements to specifiy low resolution rendering
  during camera movements. (indicies...)
- specify low rendering specs, i.e. when camera is moving
  the iterations for some calculation could be set lower
  to increase performance during movement. after movement 
  is done the high resolution could be rendered again.
